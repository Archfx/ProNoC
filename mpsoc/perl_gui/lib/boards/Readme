For adding any Altera FPGA board follow these instructions:
    1- Search for your board qsf file (e.g "FPGA_Board_Name.qsf"). This file must contain the FPGA device name with other necessary global project setting including the pin assignments.

    2- Make sure the Qsf file does not contain following assignments:
        1- "set_global_assignment -name TOP_LEVEL_ENTITY ..." : This line defines  the top level module name and will be added by GUI interface
        2- "set_global_assignment -name VERILOG_FILE" or set_global_assignment -name SYSTEMVERILOG_FILE" : These assignments are used for adding source file to the project. The source file will be added by GUI automatically. 

    3- Make a new project in Quartus. 
    4- Open new Project directory and replace the content of project.qsf file with the content of your FPGA board qsf file.
    5- In Quartus open file menu select open project. Then reopen the same project again to update the new qsf file setting.
    6- Now in Assignment menu open pin planner
    7- In pin planner go to file and select Export. Then save the pin assignment csv file. 
    8- In ./lib/board make a folder with the name of your FPGA board. (make sure the name does not contain any space)
    9- In the newly created folder copy both qsf and csv files.
